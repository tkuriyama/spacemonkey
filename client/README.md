# Spacemonkey Client

The Spacemonkey client is written in Elm.

See the `src/CodeGen/` folder for Elm modules that have been auto-generated by Haskell.

## Build

The build commands are wrapped with [redo](https://redo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Running `redo all` in the directory root triggers rebuilds, but `redo` is not required. The contents of all the `all.do` files can be run as individual shell commands.

Note that the below client modules reside in `src/Modules/`, and the one specified in `src/Main.elm` will be built.


## Example HelloServer Instances

### Hello Server

`HelloServer` is Spacemonkey's Hello World. To get it to work with `localhost`, you willl ikely need some method of dealing with CORS issues (e.g. [this post](https://alfilatov.com/posts/run-chrome-without-cors/)).

### HelloServerAcid

An iteration of `HelloServer` that is materially the same from the client's perspective (on the server side, the state is persisted to disk rather than just held in memory).


### HelloServerPersist

Similar to `HelloServerAcid`, with a different persistence backend on the server side and marginally different API.


## Spacemonkey

A client for the Spacemonkey server, a small social network application built around a grid.
