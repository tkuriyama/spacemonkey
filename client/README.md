# Spacemonkey Client

The Spacemonkey client is written in Elm.

See the `src/CodeGen/` folder for Elm modules that have been auto-generated by Haskell.

## Build

The build commands are wrapped with [redo](https://redo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Running `redo all` in the directory root triggers rebuilds, but `redo` is not required. The contents of all the `all.do` files can be run as individual shell commands. 


## HelloServer

`HelloServer` is Spacemonkey's Hello World. To get it to work with `localhost`, you willl ikely need some method of dealing with CORS issues (e.g. [this post](https://alfilatov.com/posts/run-chrome-without-cors/)).

## HelloServerAcid

An iteration of `HelloServer` that is materially the same from the client's perspective (on the server side, the state is persistent to disk rather than just in memory).
