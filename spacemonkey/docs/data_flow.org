# Data Flow 

## Haskell -> Elm (Client Types and JSON De/Serialization)

1. Specifications for Haskell data types in `src/Modules/`
2. Specifications for generating bindings for Haskell data types in `make/Make/`
3. `make/Main.hs` should run one or more of the make scripts in `make/Make/`
4. The ELm generated files generated by Step 3 are ready for use 

The `spacemonkey/redo.all` script has the shell commands for all steps, from `stack install`, to running the excecutable, to moving the generated Elm files. 


## Haskell -> Haskell (Server JSON De/Serialization)

- The definition of the Servant server and the use of `Data.Aeson` suffices


## Haskell <> Persistence
